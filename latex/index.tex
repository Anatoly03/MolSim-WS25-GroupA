 This project provides a powerful interface to run particle simulations. The current version of the project is fairly limited in features, however optimizations and support for more complex particle simulations are to come.

To contribute or build the project locally, first run the {\ttfamily build.\+sh} file. This will setup CMake, create the Makefile and run the help message of the project. You can find the code documentation of the master branch at \href{https://anatoly03.github.io/MolSim-WS25-GroupA/index.html}{\texttt{ our Git\+Hub Pages}} or you can opt to build it locally using the {\ttfamily doc\+\_\+doxygen} target in the Makefile.

Before commiting it\textquotesingle{}s recommended to run make with {\ttfamily format} target as we care about the project remaining clean!

To get rid of output files we provide the {\ttfamily clean-\/vtk} target with make. Happy simulations!
